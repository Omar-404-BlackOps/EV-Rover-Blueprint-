## 11/8/2025 - Searching needed Hardware materials  

	I started searching for the needed materials to start constructing the robot, I have done my research using Egyptian electronics shops' online websites: (Future electronics, Free electronics, Makers and RAM electronics).
	During the research I found that some of the materials are out of stock from some shops while other shops provide these materials but are of stock of other needed materials, but finally I found that "RAM electronics" provides most of the needed materials so, I am planning to purchase the hardware materials form "RAM".
	I also got the price of the main hardware parts and electronics for the Initial assembly, this screenshot from "RAM" website shows the total price:![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTM3NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3e4966bb6588d13c438b82e0a31e99513c708cfa/image.png)

After this step I plan to get the fund from Blueprint, so I can purchase those materials and start assembling and programing them.
